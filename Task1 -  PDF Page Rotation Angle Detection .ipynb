    "## PDF Page Rotation Angle Detection Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Implement the `determine_rotation_angle` function within the given code structure to detect the rotation angle of each page in a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Structure:\n",
    "The main function `rotate_all_pages_upright` is already implemented, but if necessary you are allowed to change its implementation. Your task is to complete the `determine_rotation_angle` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "- A PDF file path (the function should be able to handle various PDF files)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- A list of integers, where each integer represents the rotation angle needed for a page in the PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation Angle:\n",
    "- The rotation angle should be in degrees, normalized to the range [0, 359].\n",
    "- 0 means the page is already upright\n",
    "- 90 means the page needs to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to be upright\n",
    "- and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "1. Implement the `determine_rotation_angle` function:\n",
    "   - Input: A single page object (PdfReader.PageObject)\n",
    "   - Output: An integer representing the rotation angle in degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function should analyze the content of the page and determine the angle needed to make the page upright.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. The function should work with different PDF files, not just a specific one.\n",
    "2. Implement robust methods to determine the correct rotation angle.\n",
    "3. Handle potential exceptions or edge cases (e.g., pages with mixed orientations, complex layouts).\n",
    "4. Optimize for both accuracy and processing speed, as the function will be called for each page in the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "- You are allowed to use up to 40GB of GPU VRAM if necessary for your implementation.\n",
    "- You may create as many additional functions as needed to support your implementation.\n",
    "- You may use additional libraries if required, but ensure they are imported properly.\n",
    "- Provide clear comments in your code to explain your rotation detection logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing:\n",
    "- Test your implementation with various types of PDFs to ensure its robustness and generalizability.\n",
    "- The main script provides a way to test your implementation on a file named \"grouped_documents.pdf\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The task involves determining the rotation angle only. The actual rotation of the pages is not required in this implementation."
